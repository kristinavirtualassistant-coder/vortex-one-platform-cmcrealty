# Vortex One Portable Deployment Contract

Vortex One is designed to run with standard Node.js and PostgreSQL configuration. The runtime has no infrastructure-provider dependency.

## Required runtime configuration

Use either:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE
```

or the standard variables:

```text
SQL_HOST=HOST
SQL_PORT=5432
SQL_DB_NAME=DATABASE
SQL_USER=USER
SQL_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
SQL_SSL=false
```

`DATABASE_URL` may include `sslmode=require`. The application derives the host, port, user, password, database, and SSL requirement from the URL unless explicit SQL_* values override them.

Production startup requires an available PostgreSQL database. The application must not silently fall back to in-memory state in production.

## Local/no-cost mode

Requirements:

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local installation)
- Git

Start the isolated local database and application with:

```bash
./scripts/local-dev.sh
```

The script uses a local PostgreSQL data directory and port 5433 by default. Override them with `VORTEX_LOCAL_PGDATA`, `VORTEX_LOCAL_PGPORT`, and `VORTEX_LOCAL_PGSOCKET` when needed.

The local script enables local development authentication only and does not create cloud resources.

## Container mode

Build and run the portable Node.js container:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
docker build -t vortex-one:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL='postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE' \
  vortex-one:local
```

The container requires only Node.js, PostgreSQL, and the configured external integrations.

## RingCentral

RingCentral is an external telephony provider. Configure its credentials only through the deployment secret mechanism:

- `RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID`
- `RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `RINGCENTRAL_JWT`
- `RINGCENTRAL_WEBHOOK_VALIDATION_TOKEN`
- `RINGCENTRAL_FROM_NUMBER`
- optional `RINGCENTRAL_SERVER_URL`

Do not expose RingCentral credentials through `VITE_*` variables or store them in PostgreSQL records.

## Database migrations

Application startup applies the repository migrations transactionally. PostgreSQL is authoritative for production state.

Before a production cutover, verify:

1. the target PostgreSQL instance is reachable;
2. all expected migrations are applied;
3. tenant constraints and indexes are present;
4. durable jobs and processed-event idempotency tables are present;
5. critical row counts and hashes match the migration source/target verification plan; and
6. backup and restore have been tested.

## Health checks

- `GET /api/health` verifies the application process is reachable.
- `GET /api/ready` reports readiness only when PostgreSQL is connected and authoritative.

A 503 readiness response is expected when PostgreSQL is unavailable.

## Free-tier-first hosting

A hosted deployment may use a free/low-cost web host and a PostgreSQL provider with a suitable free tier where current provider limits permit it. The application architecture does not depend on a particular vendor.

Free tiers must not be treated as equivalent to production-grade availability, backup retention, webhook reliability, or sustained dialer capacity. Live RingCentral calling also incurs telephony/provider costs even when application hosting is free.
